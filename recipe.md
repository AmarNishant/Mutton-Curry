The steps to make it are :

1) Gather the ingredients.

2) Heat the cooking oil in a heavy-bottomed large pan over medium heat.

3) When hot, add the onions. Sauté until the onions begin to turn a pale golden brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Turn off the heat but leave the remaining oil in the pan.

4) Grind the onions into a smooth paste (adding very little to no water) in a food processor. Once smooth, move into a separate container.

5) Grind the tomatoes and garlic and ginger pastes together in the food processor into a smooth paste. Set aside for later use.

6) Heat the oil over medium heat leftover from frying the onions and add the onion paste. Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes.

7) Add the tomato, garlic, and ginger paste followed by the garam masala, coriander, cumin, turmeric, and red chili powder. Mix well.

8) Sauté the resulting masala (onion-tomato-spice mixture) until the oil begins to separate from it. This can take up to 10 minutes.

9) Add the goat or sheep pieces to the masala, season with salt to taste, and stir to fully coat the meat with the masala. Sauté until the goat or sheep is browned well.

10) Add 1/2 a cup of hot water to the pan and stir to mix well. Bring to a simmer and cover the pan. Cook until the meat is tender. You will need to keep checking on the goat or sheep as it cooks and adding more water to the sauce if all the water dries up. Stir often to prevent burning. The dish should have a fairly thick gravy when done.

11) When the meat is cooked and the sauce has thickened, garnish with chopped coriander and serve hot.
